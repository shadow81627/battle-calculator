                A fast and powerful Army List Creator for tabletop wargamers.
              </p>

              <p>
                It allows you to quickly and easily create army lists for a
                large range of game systems and armies. Your points limit and
                army selections are validated so you can see if you've made any
                mistakes, and the easy to read output will summarise your units'
                profiles and special rules for quick reference.
